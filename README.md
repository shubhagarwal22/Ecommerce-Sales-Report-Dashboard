Analyzed Ecommerce Sales Data in which I have created an interactive dashboard using Power BI
I have used a image for better background quality
I have used a detail.csv file which contains multiple columns such as Order ID, Amount, Profit etc.
I have also used a order.csv  file which contains multiple columns such as Order ID, Order Date, Customer Name, State, City.
Using this data I have constructed this dashboard from scratch which includes multiple Slicers, dropdown list, filters, Bar charts etc which can give the viewer an breif description about this data.
